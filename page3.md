* In your main repo page, go to **<>code**;
  * choose **create new file**;
  * name your new page being sure to include `newpagename.md` with .md at the end;
  * add new content
* then create a commit for the new page to a new repo branch;
## 2. Create a link to the newly created page on your main website
* return to **<>code** tab on the new pull request page;
* now, in the main repo page, select the `.md` file **where you want to add a link** to the new page;
* be sure you're on the new branch for merging the pull request (rather than the master branch);
  * click on **pencil icon** to edit and add the new html link to the new page
  * for example _Find the link [here] (http://github.com)_
* then scroll down and commit directly to the new pull request branch;
* Merge that new pull request into a new branch
